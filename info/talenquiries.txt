"Ms","","Andrea","Kaiser","andrea_kaiser@gmx.de","Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a student from the U.S. Webster Graduate Studies Centre, London, and
I am performing a market research project. Subject: Theatres in London and
how they market themselves. 

- What marketing activities is your company involved in? 

- Do you know statistics about the client base of the theatres?

- Do you know about market size of London's theatres?

I would be very delighted if you could help me.
Thank you for your answer. 

Regards

"Miss","","Beth","vonKelsch","djboofenstuff@cs.com","I am living in a city that has yet to discover its theatrical freedom.  (At this point, the riskiest productions involve Sam Shepard plays.) I am attempting, with a substantial group of supporters, to turn the theatre environment into a progressive atmosphere.  One aspect of my attempt is a monthly circulating newsletter--although it is rather proactive, I try to stay away from blatant proganda.  I would appreciate any words, opinions, or otherwise, to include in the newsletter.  It would be helpful to my readers to not have a completely singular opinion (i.e. mine).  I understand if you deny my request due to libel or copyright laws.  But I would even appreciate any advice on reconstructing or (dare I say it) revolutionizing theatre in my area--Richmond, Virginia.  Any reply at all would be helpful.  Thank you.

"Mr","","Wyn","Middleton","wynmiddleton@yahoo.com","Hi,

I came across your site and am keen to find out a little more about what Twice As Loud are up to.
Do you have any productions planned for the near future?

I am currently attending Morley College's Theatre School.
Our end of term production (June 28th & 29th) is David Hare's Plenty.
Feel free to come along.

I am keen to get involved in fringe theatre myself and possibly even start my own company, although the horrendous costs I know would be involved makes the whole idea seem less and less appealing the more I think about it. I would, however, be very interested to learn more about Twice As Loud and your experiences with fringe theatre.

If you've got time to reply, feel free to drop me a line.
Perhaps I could even meet up with some of you guys and quiz you some more.

Regards,

Wyn Middleton
